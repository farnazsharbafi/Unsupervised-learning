# Unsupervised-learning
Group work
This repository contains the unsupervised learning algorithms to analyse the women and development
dataset. This dataset contains several variables about women and men in business, life
expectancy, marriage, banking account ownership, female business ownership, seats of women
in national parliament, and the women index in business and law. The purpose of this analysis is
to find out which countries are more similar according to the women's conditions as described by
the variables used. The analyses are performed using the R programming language. Two unsupervised learning algorithms
are implemented, k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.
